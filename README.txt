Credits to arcadeperfect for his svg2gcode for grbl:
https://github.com/arcadeperfect/svg2gcode_grbl/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file

Used his converter to do all the "grunt" work of finding paths and defining them. 
Adapted the convert.py file for better parsing, unit conversion and to accomodate multiple colours.
Also implemented a GUI.

Congratulations on acquiring the world's one and only Rainbow Plotter by MAD.

To use this machine, download the following:
1. SVGtoGcode.exe from this repository
2. GRBL-Plotter: https://grbl-plotter.de/

Plug the machine into a wall socket, disengage the emergency stop, and connect the Arduino controller to your computer via USB cable.

The source code for the SVGtoGCode program can be found in the SVGtoGCode folder in this repository. This program converts SVG images to GCode instructions for the Rainbow Plotter to execute. Credit is due to arcadeperfect for his svg2gcode_grbl repository (https://github.com/arcadeperfect/svg2gcode_grbl), which was adapted to create the program used for this project.

A full technical report is also included in this repository, detailing the design, build, software development and testing process of the Rainbow Plotter.
